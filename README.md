# ML-GCP
This is the official repository for paper "**Machine Learning Reveals Glycolytic Key Gene in Gastric Cancer Prognosis**".

The relevant data and code will be released here as soon as they are organized!

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the epository
```
git clone https://github.com/leenamx/ML-GCP.git
```

We recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. We used Python and R for development and experiments.

Here is the introduction for Python envrionment development:
```
conda create -n mlgcp python=3.9
conda activate mlgcp
```

Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

run the code
```
python ./src/MLGCP.py
```
